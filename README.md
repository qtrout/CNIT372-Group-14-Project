# CNIT372-Group-14-Project
Group 14's group project for CNIT 372


--Theme and Purpose
/*
The theme for our project is that we are researching YouTube statistics based how general users use YouTube which is defined as people whose activity on the site is dominated by activities outside of uploading content. This includes researching viewing numbers of videos, subscribing to content creators, etc. We also chose this because we thought it would give us the most amount of data to work with during our research and make tables and functions.

The purpose of this research is that we want to focus on and figure out how trends in user interaction have changed over time. Through gaining this research we hope to find trends in users interactions with content creators which we can use to help creators or company help better interact with their audience and possibly grow their audience to improve their channel or brand.

--Instructions for code
/*
The way you can our code is to choose what information you would like to find based on what questions we've answered and called the procedure/function that covers that question which are named around which question they answer. Some of the functions/procedure will then run and pull the proper answers from the table we've made based on the Global YouTube Statistics we chose to use and some will also use cursors or triggers to help with this.

You will called the function/procedure by either:

If procedure-
    execute procedure_name;

If function-
    select function_name(parameter(s))
    from table_name;
